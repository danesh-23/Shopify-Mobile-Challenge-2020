# A+Papers: IB Exam Papers ![](favicon.ico)

## What is it?  

A+Papers is a family of apps designed for students enrolled in pre-university programmes such as A-Levels/IGCSE/IB Diploma to easily access past exam papers for practise as it is arguably the most effective method of preparing for the exams. It gathers resources students use daily and organises and presents it to the user in a clean and linear way that makes it easy to navigate. From research we have done on students, A+Papers has shown to result in a 33% decrease in time for students to access the past exam paper they want compared to manually searching for it on a web browser, a figure that accumulates largely when it is being done multiple times daily.

A+Papers also provides functionalities such as printing any paper with a single click using iOS native AirPrint protocol and also downloading and saving any past exam papers they want for offline use so they don't need an internet connection to study.

Amazingly, A+Papers has resonated strongly with each community of students and we've receieved many messages of appreciation, detailing how the app has helped them, made it easier and faster and just more accessible to students and this is what drives me to maintain this app for students worldwide.
